Voicespitcher 4 for EqualizerAPO and VSTPlugin systems

Voicespitcher 4 is a simple yet very effective and transparent brickwall limiter and tone-booster that is suitable for individual tracks as well as mastering work. On top of the peak limiter, a soft-knee peak compressor is included with adjustable ratio, threshold, attack and release times.
